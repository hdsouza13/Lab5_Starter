1) Would you use a unit test to test the “message” feature of a messaging application? Why or why not? For this question, assume the “message” feature allows a user to write and send a message to another user.

- I wouldn't advocate for this approach because unit testing might not effectively assess the application's performance on a larger scale, making it impractical to verify if messages are correctly received by other users.

2) Would you use a unit test to test the “max message length” feature of a messaging application? Why or why not? For this question, assume the “max message length” feature prevents the user from typing more than 80 characters.

- I would support this approach because testing the "max message length" is feasible independently of any other users receiving the message. This aspect represents an edge case suitable for unit testing.
